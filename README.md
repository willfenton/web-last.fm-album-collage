# Last.fm Album Art Collage

I've previously built a [desktop application](https://github.com/willfenton/Last.fm-Data-Tool) capable of generating album art collages, this project does the same thing but on the web, for my personal website. It will constantly update, so that I can see my most up to date collage without having to run my desktop app.
